This repo basically includes codes of four research works for my PhD thesis: [Practical Neural Entity Alignment](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:b088971/s4602675_phd_thesis.pdf).
In addition, a unified framework that can integrate these four research works is going to be developed. 
The goal is to boost the performance of entity alignment through their combination and facilitate more explorations in the defined conceptual framework.
